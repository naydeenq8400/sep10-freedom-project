Since my first blog, I have been learning more about how justice systems work and the technology used in law enforcement. I searched for information about tools and software that help police and courts solve crimes. One interesting thing I found was about fingerprint analysis. This technology helps identify people quickly by matching fingerprints with data stored in databases. I saw pictures of fingerprint scanners on https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/fingerprints-and-other-biometrics, and it looks like a small device that collects fingerprints easily.

I also learned about surveillance cameras. These cameras are placed in many public places and help police monitor activity. I found out that modern cameras can record in high quality and even recognize faces using special software. I looked into how facial recognition works and found that it uses algorithms to compare faces with images in a database. I learned about this from https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition.

Another tool I discovered is data analysis software. This software helps officers analyze large amounts of data from different sources, like phone records, emails, and security footage. It makes it easier to find clues in a big amount of information. I read about this on https://www.policeone.com/investigations/articles/.

# How I Found This
To find the information, I researched a bunch of websites and searched up things related to the justice system. Some of what i searched up were “tools used in justice system”, “technology in law enforcement.”, “fingerprint analysis technology,”, “surveillance cameras,”, and “data analysis software for police.” 


# Engineering Design Process

For the engineering design process i am in the process of researching websites and information. The information i am researching are about different tools and software used in justice systems, like digital forensic programs and video conferencing systems. My goal is to understand how these technologies work and how they can be improved or combined to make justice more fair and efficient.

# Skills

Since I started this project, I have developed two main skills: googling better and organizing information.

### Google Searching:

At first, I just typed simple words like “justice system” or “court technology,” but I didn’t get the right results. Now, I know to use specific words and questions, like “how digital evidence is used in court” or “AI tools for justice,” which give me better and more relevant results. I also learned to look for trustworthy sources, such as official websites or articles from experts. This skill helps me find accurate information faster, which is very helpful for my research.

### Organizing Information:

I also improved in organizing what I find. I make notes of important facts and keep track of the websites I visit. I also write summaries in my own words to understand better. For example, I explain how forensic tools help find hidden data on computers or how video calls help courts save time. This helps me remember what I learn and explain it clearly in my projects.

# Next Steps

Next, I plan to keep exploring new technologies used in justice systems. I want to learn more about how these tools are made and how they can be improved. I am excited to create a simple project that shows how technology can help make justice faster and fairer for everyone. I also want to work on managing my time better and improving my search skills, so I can learn even more efficiently in the future.
